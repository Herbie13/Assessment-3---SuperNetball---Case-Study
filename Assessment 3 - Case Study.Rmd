# Assessment 3 - Case Study
# David Herbert
# Date: Monday 10th March
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Introduction 
# This case study examines player and team performance in the 2020 Super Netball season, focusing on key performance indicators that coaches can use to enhance their decision-making. After some investigation I found the key analytcial areas that Netball Coaches wish to know about include:
# - Top Performers (Player & Team)
# - Scoring efficiency
# - Turnovers & possession control
# - Defensive strength
# - Midcourt performance
# - Discipline (penalties & fouls)

# Included from Alice Sweeting lecture
# Create a new Rmarkdown file in my directory
# "flex_dashboard_bslib" sets up a repsonsive interactive dashboard layout 
rmarkdown::draft("dashboard.Rmd",
                 template = "flex_dashboard_bslib",
                 package = "flexdashboard")

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Load up required packages, data and check the data is clean and structured correctly
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Firstly ensure all required packages are loaded in the library
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(viridis)
library(flexdashboard)

# Load and Clean the Data set we intend to use
SuperNetball_data <- read_csv("Dataset3_Assessment3.csv")

# Visualise the entire Super Netball data set within the source to ensure it is loaded
View(SuperNetball_data)

# Using the Head funstion list the first 6 lines of the Super Netball data set
head(SuperNetball_data)

# Clean the Super Netball data set and see if their are any missing values
sum(is.na(SuperNetball_data))
# No missing data found 

# Using str function ensure the structure of the dataset is correct 
str(SuperNetball_data)

# Convert both 'Athlete' and 'Team' to categorical variables this allows my R analysis to become more efficient, accurate, and visually clear.  It correctly groups data to assist in visualisations.
SuperNetball_data <- SuperNetball_data %>%
  mutate(Athlete = as.factor(Athlete),
         Team = as.factor(Team),

# Using the distinct() function ensures there are no duplicates and removes them as necessary 
SuperNetball_data <- SuperNetball_data %>%
  distinct() 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Look at the Statisical Distribution of the Super Netball data by creating a boxplot
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Create a Boxplot of Statistical Distribution and then develop this using colourblind friendly colours.
# This boxplot will help with essential understanding of the distribution of player performance in Netball
# It will help the coach identify strengths, weaknesses and anomalies
# It can help to enhance decision making for player development, game startegy and recruitment of players.
